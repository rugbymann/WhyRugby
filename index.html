    <h1>Why is Rugby better than football?</h1>

    <p>
        The sport of rugby is more complex than football and offers a greater variety of ways to score points. <br>
        In football, scoring one goal is often all that is necessary for the team to win. What is this? <br>
        Rugby allows for many different types of victory, making it a more exciting game to watch.

        Kids playing rugby enjoy several physical, social, and mental skills, which will bode well with them as they
        approach their adulthood and beyond. <br>It also promotes teamwork, keeps kids out of mischief, and boosts the
        concentration level of a child. <br>

        Furthermore, rugby offers kids- whether small or large, slim or heavy, short or stout, agile or speedster- equal
        opportunities to run with the ball, pass it, and play defense. <br> In rugby, everyone needs to participate that
        way; nobody gets left out. <br>
        In rugby, games where kids are between the age of 5 to 9, there is no contact. Touch or flag rugby is often
        played.
